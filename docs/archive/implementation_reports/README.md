## Purpose

These documents have been archived because:

1. **Historical Record**: They document the development journey but are no longer needed for day-to-day reference
2. **Hackathon Focus**: The project is now demo-ready with simplified documentation focused on core features
3. **Feature Scope Changes**: Many documented features have been disabled for the hackathon demonstration

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date documentation, see:
- **[README.md](../../README.md)** - Main project overview (hackathon-focused)
- **[HACKATHON_GUIDE.md](../../HACKATHON_GUIDE.md)** - Complete hackathon demo guide
- **[CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)** - Claude Code development guidance

## Version

These reports cover development from initial project setup through v1.0.0-hackathon release.
