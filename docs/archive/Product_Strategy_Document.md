## Market Analysis

### Market Gap

There is a **$460,000 gap** between current AI chatbots ($80/month) and full-scale consulting engagements ($500,000/project). ConsultantOS aims to disrupt this space by offering premium analysis tools at a price-point accessible to independents.

### Market Size Estimates

- **TAM:** $82 Billion

- **SAM:** 50,000+ independent consultants

- **SOM (Year 1):** 255 consultants (~$150K ARR)

### Industry Trends

- **Rise of Independent Consultants:** A growing wave of management consultants are leaving large firms to launch boutique practices.

- **Advancement in AI/Automation:** Increasing reliance on AI-driven frameworks and research tools reduces manual workload.

- **Demand for Affordable Expertise:** As consulting budgets shrink, smaller firms and businesses seek more affordable, yet credible, strategic advice.

- **On-Demand Economy:** Clients expect faster turnaround, driving demand for tools that compress project timelines.

### Competitor Analysis
